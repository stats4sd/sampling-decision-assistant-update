<h4>Sampling Weights</h4>
<p>
  When sampling a population, you might not be taking a sample that proportionally represents segments of the
  population of interest. If you decided to disaggregate your estimates in the previous step, you may have noticed that
  the groups you are intending to split your target population into do not divide it up equally.
  <br><br>
  In order to be able to give estimates for the population as a whole, you would need to account for the different
  proportional sizes of those groups. This is done using sampling weights. In general, we recommend consulting a
  sampling statistician to derive sampling weights, so this is likely not up to you to calculate, but
  <strong>it is important that you record and retain the relevant information.</strong>
  <br><br>
  As you carry out your sampling, you will be obtaining or developing sampling frames (a list of all the sampling units
  in that sampling stage) for each stage in your sampling scheme. For sampling weights to be derived, you will need to
  provide these lists of sampling units, including the size of each unit. These sizes should be measured as a number of
  the final sampling unit you chose in step 3. You will need to record these figures for all your strata at each
  sampling stage. This information must be retained and kept together with the final sampling design description.
