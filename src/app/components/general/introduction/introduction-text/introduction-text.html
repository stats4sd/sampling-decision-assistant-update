    <p>The purpose of the Sampling Decision Assistant is to provide a tool to support the design of sampling strategies
      among
      UNHCR staff when there is a need for primary data collection as mentioned in the
      <a href="http://needsassessment.unhcr.org/" target="_blank">UNHCR Needs Assessment Handbook</a>. These operations
      often arise as part of needs assessment processes when not enough
      information is available from secondary sources. In those cases it is important to remember that the
      appropriateness
      and feasibility of different data collection methodologies will depend on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The objectives of the primary data collection exercise</li>
      <li>Constraints and limitations</li>
      <li>The context</li>
      <li>The expected benefits and costs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A careful choice of the data collection methods is important, and whatever the choice, each has advantages and
      disadvantages.
      If sampling is involved in the process, then you will need to decide whether
      <glossary-link slug="probability-based-sampling" customDefinition="When you click on a link in the app more information will be displayed."></glossary-link>
      is possible, this will produce a sample that is representative of the population. Alternatively, the information
      may come
      from a sample drawn using
      <glossary-link slug="non-probability-based-sampling" customDefinition="A glossary is included which will help to define key terms."></glossary-link>
      which will have limitations in so far as making inferences about the population. Either choice has consequences
      on how the resulting information can be used.
      <!-- If you want to understand the difference between these two approaches see the
      resources
      section “Probability-based or non-probability-based sampling, that is the question!”. -->

      The following screens will take you through a series of questions intended to help you thinking about decisions
      and information
      that is needed to design a sampling strategy that uses probability-based sampling.
