    <br><br>
    <strong>Baseline Assessment of the Children under 5 Wellbeing Programme</strong>
    <br><br>
    This is an anonymised adaptation of a real survey. You can read the briefing document and watch our video
    walkthrough of how to work through the tool to design a sampling plan, as well as downloading the project data and
    exploring it for yourself.
