        "a": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">One obvious case is when the population of interest is small, and we are able to get information from each element of the population. In these cases, a census is possible and it would be better, and probably not much more difficult or expensive, than a representative sample.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">In general, a representative sample would be more desirable than a non-representative sample when the objective is to make inferences about the population. However, in some cases it is not possible to go through the process of getting a representative sample and we need to use non-representative samples.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">For example: when the population of interest cannot be properly identified or found. This may happen when there is an intrinsic interest from the people in the study population not to be found. For example, when they want to avoid negative consequences such as imprisonment or deportation, or when the subject of interest is legally or morally considered undesirable.&nbsp; In these cases we may need to use ways to get to elements of the population of interest that are based on networks of contacts using methods like snow ball sampling or Respondent Driven Sampling, which attempts to improve the results from snow ball sampling using a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for the fact that we are using a non-representative sample.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Some common methods that yield non-representative samples are: accessibility sampling and quota sampling. One would need a strong justification before using them to make inferences and the findings can be regarded as disputable. People often use them because these methods make life easier during the field operations, but the issues of bias and the impossibility to calculate margins of errors, are serious drawbacks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

        "a": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">A representative sample is needed when the results are going to be used to make statements about the overall population. In those cases, it is important to minimise the sources of bias, and to be able to say what is the value of estimate of interest, in other words, what is the margin of error in the estimation. Representative, probability-based samples, allow the estimation of the characteristic of interest and to establish the margin of error.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">The contrast is with samples that cannot be said to be representative, and that provide reliable information only about the elements that are included in the sample. In practice, the same arithmetic operations that are carried out on the data from a representative sample can be carried out using the data from a non-representative sample. The difference is in whether we can use the resulting estimate to make reliable inferences. The risk of making inferences from non-representative samples is that our estimates may be subject to unknown biases and we have no way to quantify the margins of error. The latter is due to the fact that statistical theory does not apply to non-representative samples. However, the use of non-representative samples is sometimes necessary when it is impossible to draw a representative sample. In those situations they are better than no information at all.</p>",

        "a": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Baselines and endlines require establishing the values of a set of indicators in a population at two particular points in time: at the beginning and at the end of a process. Often these characterisations require a process of sampling at each of those points. It makes sense to develop a good sampling design for a baseline so that efficient estimates are possible. Baseline and end-line designs should, whenever possible, have as similar sampling designs as possible so as to allow better comparisons.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Sometimes endline and baseline comparisons also involve the study of intervention and control sites. In those cases, there are issues about how realistic the control or comparison sites may be, but if we can assume that the “control subset” of the population provides a good countrefactual, then a good sampling design would be of benefit to the characterisation of the intervened and control populations – both at baseline and endline.

        "a": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">In studies that deal with estimation of population characteristics, we are interested in\nfinding out something about the population as it is. We do not intervene to\nchange the conditions of any of the members of the population for the purposes\nof the study.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">In these cases we need to decide how to take samples from the population, and the aim of\nthe design (that is the set of decisions that are made) is to &nbsp;estimate the value and variability of\nindicators of interest. Typical examples of this are the profiling exercises\nthat are carried out on refugee or internally displaced populations. In these\ncases the design principles that apply are those related to sampling methods.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Studies that compare interventions, intend to establish whether there are differences\nin the outcomes of one or more interventions. One could also say that the\nobjective is to measure the extent to which any of the interventions perfoms\nbetter.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">For example, we may want to establish whether the amount of firewood consumed by\nrefugee households is reduced when an improved model of cooker is introduced.\nIn such case, we would deliberately change the type of cooker that some\nhouseholds use by introducing improved cookers (this will be our intervention),\nwith the specific objective of comparing their fuel performance against that of\ntraditional cookers. This leads to designs where each treatment is assigned to\na subset of the households in such a manner that we maximise the ability of the\nstudy to compare cooker performance. This comparability is enhanced by\ncontrolling who and how a household receives a particular treatment. In these\ncases, the design principles that apply are those of experimental design.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">In practical field conditions we often end up designing quasi-experiments, that is\nexperiments that are conducted under conditions when controlling all undesired\ninfluencing factors is not always possible.

For example, probability based sampling at the level of households if the main interest of the study has to do with indicators of food security at household level. A probability based sampling process is the best way to address issues of bias in the selection of a sample. By the way, many people use the expression: “statistical sampling” as a short hand for probability based sampling.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">•<span style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Secondly: the sample size should be large enough to give us a good picture of the variability of the population. A sample of an appropriate size should be able to describe the variability of a population. The most common question asked when designing a sampling study is “what sample size do I need?”, this tool will help you gathering information that you need to get to a point where this question can begin to be answered. Please follow the steps suggested for designing your sampling process. You will soon get to the section about deciding the sample size.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Strictly speaking we should talk about representative estimates rather than representative samples. That is, sample estimates that are unbiased and for which we can calculate margins of error. A sample that has the characteristics mentioned above would give the minimum conditions to get representative estimates. There is however one more thing that would be required in the estimation process. It should take into account weights that need to be attached to each observation in our sample. Whether we need to use weights in our estimation process and how those weights are derived, depends on how the sample has been drawn. This tool will help you keeping a record of the information that will be useful to inform how to carry out the estimation process and how to derive weights. Derivation of weights is rarely an easy process and we advise consulting an experienced statistician for this purpose. When doing so, the information you will systematise in this tool will be particularly useful.</p>"

If that is the case, this over- or under-representation would need to be corrected for if you calculate an estimate for the overall population. This is done using sampling weights.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For example:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Imagine our population of interest is all of the refugee households in a large camp. We know there are ‘old arrival’ households – that is, they arrived two or more years ago – and there are households that are ‘new arrivals’, who have been in the camp for less than two years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the camp, there are 15200 households in total. Out of those, 3200 are old arrivals and 12000 are new arrivals.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample of 800 households has been selected, with 400 old arrival households, and 400 new arrival households. That means that half of our sample is old arrival households, even though the proportion of old arrival households in the camp is actually much smaller - just over a fifth of the total population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why did we take equally sized samples from differently sized populations, then? One reason is that it ensures our estimates for new and old arrivals have similar margins of error.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is useful for our disaggregated estimates, but it does make things more complicated if we want to calculate an overall estimate for all the households in the camp. If we do this with the estimates as they are, new arrivals will be under-represented and old arrivals will be over-represented. We can correct this using sampling weights.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can think about sampling weights as follows:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the population, we have 3200 old arrivals, and our sample has 400 old arrivals. Each old arrival household in the sample represents 3200/400=8 households in the population. Therefore, the weight for each sampled old arrival household is 8.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We have 12000 new arrivals in our population, and our sample has 400 new arrivals. Each new arrival household in the sample represents 12000/400=30 households in the population. Therefore, the weight for each sampled new arrival household is 30.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most sampling schemes are more complex than this example, and this can make the calculation of weights complicated. In general, it would be better to seek advice from a sampling statistician to derive sampling weights. You need to keep the correct information so it is available in order for this calculation to be carried out.</p>"
