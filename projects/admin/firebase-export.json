If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling.

In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters.

In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames.

If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).",

If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).",

          "definition": "When the basic sampling unit in the population is to be found in groups or clusters, e.g. households beings in villages, the sampling is sometimes carried out by selecting a sample of clusters (e.g. villages) and observing all or a subset of the sampling units of each selected cluster. If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).",

If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect)."

If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).",

If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).",

If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).",

For example, probability based sampling at the level of households if the main interest of the study has to do with indicators of food security at household level.

Whether we need to use weights in our estimation process and how those weights are derived, depends on how the sample has been drawn.

A sample that has the characteristics mentioned above would give the\nminimum conditions to get representative estimates. There is however one more\nthing that would be required in the estimation process. It should take into\naccount weights that need to be attached to each observation in our sample. Whether\nwe need to use weights in our estimation process and how those weights are derived,\ndepends on how the sample has been drawn. This tool will help you keeping a\nrecord of the information that will be useful to inform how to carry out the\nestimation process and how to derive weights. Derivation of weights is rarely\nan easy process and we advise consulting an experienced statistician for this\npurpose. When doing so, the information you will systematise in this tool will\nbe particularly useful.<o:p></o:p></p>",

The difference is in whether we can use the\nresulting estimate to make reliable inferences. The risk of making inferences\nfrom non-representative samples is that our estimates may be subject to unknown\nbiases and we have no way to quantify the margins of error.

A sample that has the characteristics mentioned above would give the\nminimum conditions to get representative estimates. There is however one more\nthing that would be required in the estimation process. It should take into\naccount weights that need to be attached to each observation in our sample. Whether\nwe need to use weights in our estimation process and how those weights are derived,\ndepends on how the sample has been drawn. This tool will help you keeping a\nrecord of the information that will be useful to inform how to carry out the\nestimation process and how to derive weights. Derivation of weights is rarely\nan easy process and we advise consulting an experienced statistician for this\npurpose. When doing so, the information you will systematise in this tool will\nbe particularly useful.<o:p></o:p></p>",

The difference is in whether we can use the resulting estimate to make reliable inferences. The risk of making inferences from non-representative samples is that our estimates may be subject to unknown biases and we have no way to quantify the margins of error. The latter is due to the fact that statistical theory does not apply to non-representative samples.

That is, sample estimates that are unbiased and for which we can calculate margins of error. A sample that has the characteristics mentioned above would give the minimum conditions to get representative estimates. There is however one more thing that would be required in the estimation process. It should take into account weights that need to be attached to each observation in our sample. Whether we need to use weights in our estimation process and how those weights are derived, depends on how the sample has been drawn. This tool will help you keeping a record of the information that will be useful to inform how to carry out the estimation process and how to derive weights. Derivation of weights is rarely an easy process and we advise consulting an experienced statistician for this purpose.

In these cases, a census is possible and it would be better, and probably not much more difficult or expensive, than a representative sample.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">In general, a representative sample would be more desirable than a non-representative sample when the objective is to make inferences about the population. However, in some cases it is not possible to go through the process of getting a representative sample and we need to use non-representative samples.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">For example: when the population of interest cannot be properly identified or found. This may happen when there is an intrinsic interest from the people in the study population not to be found. For example, when they want to avoid negative consequences such as imprisonment or deportation, or when the subject of interest is legally or morally considered undesirable.&nbsp; In these cases we may need to use ways to get to elements of the population of interest that are based on networks of contacts using methods like snow ball sampling or Respondent Driven Sampling, which attempts to improve the results from snow ball sampling using a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for the fact that we are using a non-representative sample.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Some common methods that yield non-representative samples are: accessibility sampling and quota sampling. One would need a strong justification before using them to make inferences and the findings can be regarded as disputable. People often use them because these methods make life easier during the field operations, but the issues of bias and the impossibility to calculate margins of errors, are serious drawbacks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

In those cases, it is important to minimise the sources of bias, and to be able to say what is the value of estimate of interest, in other words, what is the margin of error in the estimation. Representative, probability-based samples, allow the estimation of the characteristic of interest and to establish the margin of error.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">The contrast is with samples that cannot be said to be representative, and that provide reliable information only about the elements that are included in the sample. In practice, the same arithmetic operations that are carried out on the data from a representative sample can be carried out using the data from a non-representative sample. The difference is in whether we can use the resulting estimate to make reliable inferences. The risk of making inferences from non-representative samples is that our estimates may be subject to unknown biases and we have no way to quantify the margins of error. The latter is due to the fact that statistical theory does not apply to non-representative samples. However, the use of non-representative samples is sometimes necessary when it is impossible to draw a representative sample. In those situations they are better than no information at all.</p>",

Often these characterisations require a process of sampling at each of those points. It makes sense to develop a good sampling design for a baseline so that efficient estimates are possible. Baseline and end-line designs should, whenever possible, have as similar sampling designs as possible so as to allow better comparisons.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Sometimes endline and baseline comparisons also involve the study of intervention and control sites. In those cases, there are issues about how realistic the control or comparison sites may be, but if we can assume that the “control subset” of the population provides a good countrefactual, then a good sampling design would be of benefit to the characterisation of the intervened and control populations – both at baseline and endline.

            "a": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">One obvious case is when the population of interest is small, and we are able to get information from each element of the population. In these cases, a census is possible and it would be better, and probably not much more difficult or expensive, than a representative sample.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">In general, a representative sample would be more desirable than a non-representative sample when the objective is to make inferences about the population. However, in some cases it is not possible to go through the process of getting a representative sample and we need to use non-representative samples.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">For example: when the population of interest cannot be properly identified or found. This may happen when there is an intrinsic interest from the people in the study population not to be found. For example, when they want to avoid negative consequences such as imprisonment or deportation, or when the subject of interest is legally or morally considered undesirable.&nbsp; In these cases we may need to use ways to get to elements of the population of interest that are based on networks of contacts using methods like snow ball sampling or Respondent Driven Sampling, which attempts to improve the results from snow ball sampling using a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for the fact that we are using a non-representative sample.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Some common methods that yield non-representative samples are: accessibility sampling and quota sampling. One would need a strong justification before using them to make inferences and the findings can be regarded as disputable. People often use them because these methods make life easier during the field operations, but the issues of bias and the impossibility to calculate margins of errors, are serious drawbacks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

            "a": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">A representative sample is needed when the results are going to be used to make statements about the overall population. In those cases, it is important to minimise the sources of bias, and to be able to say what is the value of estimate of interest, in other words, what is the margin of error in the estimation. Representative, probability-based samples, allow the estimation of the characteristic of interest and to establish the margin of error.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">The contrast is with samples that cannot be said to be representative, and that provide reliable information only about the elements that are included in the sample. In practice, the same arithmetic operations that are carried out on the data from a representative sample can be carried out using the data from a non-representative sample. The difference is in whether we can use the resulting estimate to make reliable inferences. The risk of making inferences from non-representative samples is that our estimates may be subject to unknown biases and we have no way to quantify the margins of error. The latter is due to the fact that statistical theory does not apply to non-representative samples. However, the use of non-representative samples is sometimes necessary when it is impossible to draw a representative sample. In those situations they are better than no information at all.</p>",

Often these characterisations require a process of sampling at each of those points. It makes sense to develop a good sampling design for a baseline so that efficient estimates are possible. Baseline and end-line designs should, whenever possible, have as similar sampling designs as possible so as to allow better comparisons.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Sometimes endline and baseline comparisons also involve the study of intervention and control sites. In those cases, there are issues about how realistic the control or comparison sites may be, but if we can assume that the “control subset” of the population provides a good countrefactual, then a good sampling design would be of benefit to the characterisation of the intervened and control populations – both at baseline and endline. This tool is intended to help users design sampling processes that can be useful in those situations.</p>",

If that is the case, this over- or under-representation would need to be corrected for if you calculate an estimate for the overall population. This is done using sampling weights.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For example:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Imagine our population of interest is all of the refugee households in a large camp. We know there are ‘old arrival’ households – that is, they arrived two or more years ago – and there are households that are ‘new arrivals’, who have been in the camp for less than two years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the camp, there are 15200 households in total. Out of those, 3200 are old arrivals and 12000 are new arrivals.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample of 800 households has been selected, with 400 old arrival households, and 400 new arrival households. That means that half of our sample is old arrival households, even though the proportion of old arrival households in the camp is actually much smaller - just over a fifth of the total population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why did we take equally sized samples from differently sized populations, then? One reason is that it ensures our estimates for new and old arrivals have similar margins of error.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is useful for our disaggregated estimates, but it does make things more complicated if we want to calculate an overall estimate for all the households in the camp. If we do this with the estimates as they are, new arrivals will be under-represented and old arrivals will be over-represented. We can correct this using sampling weights.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can think about sampling weights as follows:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the population, we have 3200 old arrivals, and our sample has 400 old arrivals. Each old arrival household in the sample represents 3200/400=8 households in the population. Therefore, the weight for each sampled old arrival household is 8.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We have 12000 new arrivals in our population, and our sample has 400 new arrivals. Each new arrival household in the sample represents 12000/400=30 households in the population. Therefore, the weight for each sampled new arrival household is 30.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most sampling schemes are more complex than this example, and this can make the calculation of weights complicated. In general, it would be better to seek advice from a sampling statistician to derive sampling weights.

If all sampling units of a cluster are selected, this is known as one-stage cluster sampling. If a random selection of the sampling units in each cluster is interviewed, it is referred to as two-stage cluster sampling. In some cases, the first-stage clusters (also called primary sampling units) contain not the final sampling units, but another form of clusters as the second-stage clusters. This is a third-stage cluster samplign design. For example, the primary sampling units in an urban setting could be enumeration areas, of which a random selection is drawn. In a second step, the selected enumeration areas are divived into blocks, of which again a random selection is drawn for each enumeration area. In a final step, a simple random sample of households is drawn in each selected block. The clusters should always be non-overlapping and complete. Furthermore, it is recommended that clusters are mutually homogeneous, meaning that clusters resemble each other with regards to their internal composition of sampling units. The big advantage of cluster sampling is that a full list frame of the final sampling units(e.g.households) is not required. Only lists of the the final sampling units for the higher-level sampling units(e.g.city blocks) that were selected are needed.Even this requirement can be dropped if the final sampling units are randomly selected using techniques such as GPS sampling, the EPI method(spin the pen/bottle), or community-built sampling frames. Another advantage is that(if the clusters are geographical, i.e.the final sampling units in a cluster are geographically close) cluster sampling reduces the need to visit many different locations, thereby bringing down travel costs and time. The main disadvantage is that the cluster design decreases the efficiency of the sample.This means that a higher sample size is required compared to simple random sampling(see also design effect).",

In practice, the same arithmetic operations that are carried out on the data from a representative sample can be carried out using the data from a non-representative sample. The difference is in whether we can use the resulting estimate to make reliable inferences. The risk of making inferences from non-representative samples is that our estimates may be subject to unknown biases and we have no way to quantify the margins of error. The latter is due to the fact that statistical theory does not apply to non-representative samples.

Typical examples of this are the profiling exercises\nthat are carried out on refugee or internally displaced populations. In these\ncases the design principles that apply are those related to sampling methods.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Studies that compare interventions, intend to establish whether there are differences\nin the outcomes of one or more interventions.

This leads to designs where each treatment is assigned to\na subset of the households in such a manner that we maximise the ability of the\nstudy to compare cooker performance.

For example, probability based sampling at the level of households if the main interest of the study has to do with indicators of food security at household level. A probability based sampling process is the best way to address issues of bias in the selection of a sample. By the way, many people use the expression: “statistical sampling” as a short hand for probability based sampling.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">•<span style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>Secondly: the sample size should be large enough to give us a good picture of the variability of the population. A sample of an appropriate size should be able to describe the variability of a population. The most common question asked when designing a sampling study is “what sample size do I need?”, this tool will help you gathering information that you need to get to a point where this question can begin to be answered. Please follow the steps suggested for designing your sampling process. You will soon get to the section about deciding the sample size.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt\">Strictly speaking we should talk about representative estimates rather than representative samples. That is, sample estimates that are unbiased and for which we can calculate margins of error. A sample that has the characteristics mentioned above would give the minimum conditions to get representative estimates. There is however one more thing that would be required in the estimation process. It should take into account weights that need to be attached to each observation in our sample. Whether we need to use weights in our estimation process and how those weights are derived, depends on how the sample has been drawn. This tool will help you keeping a record of the information that will be useful to inform how to carry out the estimation process and how to derive weights. Derivation of weights is rarely an easy process and we advise consulting an experienced statistician for this purpose. When doing so, the information you will systematise in this tool will be particularly useful.</p>",

If that is the case, this over- or under-representation would need to be corrected for if you calculate an estimate for the overall population. This is done using sampling weights.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">For example:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Imagine our population of interest is all of the refugee households in a large camp. We know there are ‘old arrival’ households – that is, they arrived two or more years ago – and there are households that are ‘new arrivals’, who have been in the camp for less than two years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the camp, there are 15200 households in total. Out of those, 3200 are old arrivals and 12000 are new arrivals.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sample of 800 households has been selected, with 400 old arrival households, and 400 new arrival households. That means that half of our sample is old arrival households, even though the proportion of old arrival households in the camp is actually much smaller - just over a fifth of the total population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why did we take equally sized samples from differently sized populations, then? One reason is that it ensures our estimates for new and old arrivals have similar margins of error.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is useful for our disaggregated estimates, but it does make things more complicated if we want to calculate an overall estimate for all the households in the camp. If we do this with the estimates as they are, new arrivals will be under-represented and old arrivals will be over-represented. We can correct this using sampling weights.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can think about sampling weights as follows:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the population, we have 3200 old arrivals, and our sample has 400 old arrivals. Each old arrival household in the sample represents 3200/400=8 households in the population. Therefore, the weight for each sampled old arrival household is 8.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We have 12000 new arrivals in our population, and our sample has 400 new arrivals. Each new arrival household in the sample represents 12000/400=30 households in the population. Therefore, the weight for each sampled new arrival household is 30.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most sampling schemes are more complex than this example, and this can make the calculation of weights complicated. In general, it would be better to seek advice from a sampling statistician to derive sampling weights. You need to keep the correct information so it is available in order for this calculation to be carried out.</p>",

You can think of this as how much difference you could expect to see in the results if you repeated the survey with another random sample of the same design. If, for example, we get an estimate of the value of an indicator that is 75% and we know the margin of error is +/- 3%, we can assume* that the true value for the whole population is somewhere within this range.</p> <p>*The margin of error is linked to the confidence level, which is the probability that the assumption we mention in the example above is correct.</p> <p>The larger the margin of error, the less precise we can assume our estimate to be. Increasing the sample size reduces the margin of error.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Clustering level: </strong></p> <p>If you have sampled your final sampling units from within discrete groups (known as clusters), such as in the penultimate stage of a multi-stage sampling plan, then the units within that cluster may share certain characteristics due to the fact that they are in the same cluster. For example, the distance to market will be roughly the same for all the households within a village because they are geographically clustered. If your key indicator is distance to market, then you will not gain much more information by increasing the number of households you visit in the village.

This number will depend on various factors, including the time it takes to gather the data you need, travel, the amount of final sampling units present in each cluster, and the clustering level. The smaller this number, the more clusters you will have to reach to get to the minimum sample size, which could be expensive or difficult. However, reducing this number can reduce the minimum sample size, depending on the clustering level.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Total (final sampling units) in population:</strong></p> <p>This is the size of your entire target population as defined in step 2, measured in terms of your final sampling unit.

Any time you are taking an estimate from a sample rather than measuring the value for the whole population, there is a chance that the estimate is different to the true value, because of the random chance involved in sampling.</p> <p>In the example described above in the definition for ‘margin of error’, if we have a 95% confidence level, that means that the true value for the the population has a 95% chance of being within 3% (the margin of error) of our estimate of 75%.<br></p> <p>A 95% confidence level is the standard for this kind of estimation, and we strongly recommend you do not adjust this option unless you know that it is appropriate to do so for your particular study.</p>",
