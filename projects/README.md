The project is divided into 3 parts

1. Admin
   This is made up of legacy code previuosly used to provide a live database link for editing question and glossary entries. It is not currently functional but could be maintained as a separate project in the future.

2. App
   This is the code for the main Sampling Decision Assistant site. It reads data from the top level `data` folder and presents it across multiple pages and interactions

3. E2E
   This is another placeholder which could be used for generating end-to-end testing for the project.
